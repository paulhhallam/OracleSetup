# cf_Oracle_Mgmt_scripts Cookbook

This cookbook will create the files and directory structutres used by the CashFlows Oracle dba team to:
1) housekeep the log and audit files generated by the databases
2) Monitor the databases and CF processes

## Requirements

The oracle user with the home directory of /home/oracle must exist.

The oinstall group must exist.

The /u01/maint and /backup/oracle volumes or directories should already exist although this process will create them if they do not.
The issue here is that normally /backup and /u01 are seperate volumes and running this script before the volumes are created may cause some confusion.
